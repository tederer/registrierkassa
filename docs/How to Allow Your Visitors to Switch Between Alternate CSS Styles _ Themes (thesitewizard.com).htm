<h1>How to Allow Your Visitors to Switch Between Alternate CSS Styles / Themes</h1>
by Christopher Heng, <a href="https://www.thesitewizard.com/" target="_top">thesitewizard.com</a><br>

<p>
Cascading Style Sheets provide webmasters a lot of control over their websites' appearance. One of its features is that you
can specify different or alternate style sheets for a page. If your visitor prefers a particular design, or theme, that person
can simply switch to that theme using their browser.
<a href="https://www.thesitewizard.com/css/switch-alternate-css-styles.shtml" target="_top">This article</a> describes how you
can implement theme support, by giving your users the ability to switch between different styles on your website.
</p>

<p>
Note that there are two parts to the tutorial. This chapter deals with the Cascading Style Sheets ("CSS") component.
It is complete in itself, and with it, you can already implement CSS switching support (or theme support) on your site
for most modern browsers. The <a href="https://www.thesitewizard.com/javascripts/change-style-sheets.shtml" target="_top">next chapter</a>
provides a dynamic way for the user to permanently set the theme for your site using
JavaScript. It also adds support for browsers that do not have built-in support for switching styles.
</p>

<p>
This article requires you to have some knowledge of CSS. You don't have to be a guru or anything like that, but
a little knowledge is needed otherwise you may be completely lost. You can read a
<a href="https://www.thesitewizard.com/archive/css.shtml" target="_top">brief introduction to CSS</a> at
https://www.thesitewizard.com/archive/css.shtml
</p>

<h2>Uses of Alternate Style Sheets / Themes</h2>

<p>
There are some reasons why you might choose to supply alternate style sheets for your users.
</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>To Support Varying Tastes</h3>
<p>
Different designs appeal to different people. For example, some people like a colourful layout. Others prefer a plain
"clean" design. By providing alternate style sheets, you can cater to all users.
</p></li>
<li><h3>To Provide for Special Needs</h3>
<p>
If your site has users with special needs, for example, older people who may need larger font sizes, alternate style
sheets provide a way where you can have a large-font theme alongside a normal-sized default without having to
create two versions of the same page.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm not claiming that you must have alternate styles for your site because of these reasons. For most sites, an alternate
CSS is an overkill. However, if you have established a community where users with very different demographics repeatedly
return to your site, having alternative styles that appeal to different people may make your site more user-friendly.
</p>

<h2>Alternate CSS How-To</h2>

<p>
On most sites, web designers typically include a style sheet for their site using a link command like the following:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://example.com/css/style.css"&gt;
</div>

<p>
If you want to provide alternate style sheets for your site, you will need to give each style sheet a title, so
that the browser will know that you are providing alternatives for your site. For example, if you want to provide
two themes for your site, one called "blue" and the other "pink", you can specify them as follows, instead of the
above example.
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://example.com/css/blue.css" title="blue"&gt;<br>
&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://example.com/css/pink.css" title="pink"&gt;
</div>

<p>
Notice that the default style sheet that will be used is "blue". This is the preferred style sheet, and it is
indicated by specifying a "rel" attribute of "stylesheet". The "pink" stylesheet is an alternate style that the user
can choose. As you can see, it has a "rel" attribute of "alternate stylesheet". Another way of specifying that
a particular style sheet is to be the default is to create a meta tag like the following:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
&lt;meta http-equiv="Default-Style" content="blue"&gt;
</div>

<p>
If you specify both the "alternate stylesheet" attribute value as well as the meta tag, the latter takes
precedence. I suggest that you be consistent and stick to either one or the other method on all your pages.
It'll make debugging and modifications easier, and reduce careless mistakes in the future.
</p>

<h2>Persistent Styles</h2>

<p>
Sometimes you may want a particular style sheet to be applied no matter which theme the user selects.
Put all those common styles into a separate file, and include it without a title tag like this:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://example.com/css/common.css"&gt;
</div>

<p>
When no title tag is specified, the browser will always load that stylesheet. Such a style sheet is regarded
as "persistent".
</p>

<p>
In other words, if a persistent style sheet is added to the example site above, the HEAD section will
have the following declarations:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://example.com/css/common.css"&gt;<br>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://example.com/css/blue.css" title="blue"&gt;<br>
&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://example.com/css/pink.css" title="pink"&gt;
</div>

<p>
The common.css style sheet will always be loaded. The default style sheet that will be used is the "blue" one.
If the browser supports style switching, the visitor will be able to switch to the "pink" style as well.
</p>

<h2>Groups of Style Sheets</h2>

<p>
It is still possible to separate styles for different aspects of your web page into different files. For example, if
you like to put your menu styles in a separate file from your layout styles, you can do it this way:
</p>

<div class="codeblock">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://example.com/css/blue-menu.css" title="blue"&gt;<br>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://example.com/css/blue-layout.css" title="blue"&gt;<br>
&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://example.com/css/pink-menu.css" title="pink"&gt;<br>
&lt;link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://example.com/css/pink-layout.css" title="pink"&gt;
</div>

<p>
The browser will see all the stylesheets with a common title as one set of styles to be applied together.
</p>

<h2>How to Switch Alternate Style Sheets / Themes</h2>

<p>
Most modern browsers provide a way for your users to change style sheets for your site on-the-fly. For ease of
reference, when I say below "View | Page Style", it means to click the "View" menu, then the "Page Style" item
on the menu that appears. A list of style sheets that you can switch to will then appear.
</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Internet Explorer 8 and above</h3>
<p>
View | Style
</p></li>
<li><h3>Firefox</h3>
<p>
View | Page Style
</p></li>
<li><h3>Opera</h3>
<p>
View | Style
</p></li>
<li><h3>Konqueror</h3>
<p>
View | Use StyleSheet
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
For your convenience, I have provided an alternative to the default style for
<a href="https://www.thesitewizard.com/css/switch-alternate-css-styles.shtml" target="_top">this page</a>,
so if you have one of the above browsers, you can try out the above commands to switch between my two
style sheets. The alternate style sheet is merely the old style sheet for thesitewizard.com, which,
at this time, is being phased out.
</p>

<p>
Observe the following deficiencies in the built-in browser support for alternate style sheets:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Not all browsers support theme switching from their user interface (ie, menu). In particular, Internet Explorer 7 and
below do not support it. And when I last checked Safari in 2008 (the date I wrote this article), it didn't have the
ability to switch style sheets from its menu either.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The selections are not "sticky". When you go to another page on the same site, you will have to re-select the
theme again. (Note: don't bother trying to select an alternate theme on the other pages of thesitewizard.com.
The alternate theme is only inserted in this page so that you can see how it works.)
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The next chapter, on
<a href="https://www.thesitewizard.com/javascripts/change-style-sheets.shtml" target="_top">using JavaScript to change
the style sheet dynamically</a>, will provide a way to deal with these shortcomings.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
Alternate style sheets allow you to add a sort of theme support for your website. This chapter deals with the CSS
component of adding themes to your site. In the <a href="https://www.thesitewizard.com/javascripts/change-style-sheets.shtml" target="_top">next
chapter</a>, I will discuss how you can use JavaScript so that the 
themes can be "sticky". That is, once the user selects a theme for your 
site,
he/she will be able to view your whole site using that particular theme.
 The JavaScript will also add support for browsers that don't have
built-in style switching.
